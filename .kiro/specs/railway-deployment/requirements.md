# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will modify the existing Gmail MCP server to support deployment on Railway platform with IPv6 support and remote accessibility. The changes will enable the MCP server to be deployed as a cloud service rather than running locally, making it accessible to remote clients while maintaining security and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the Gmail MCP server on Railway, so that I can access Gmail functionality from any location without running a local server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is deployed to Railway THEN the server SHALL start successfully and be accessible via HTTPS
2. WHEN Railway builds the project THEN the build process SHALL complete without errors using the provided Dockerfile
3. WHEN the server starts on Railway THEN it SHALL bind to the correct port specified by Railway's PORT environment variable
4. WHEN Railway deploys the application THEN it SHALL use the railway.toml configuration for deployment settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to support IPv6 networking, so that it can operate in modern network environments and cloud platforms that use IPv6.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL bind to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
2. WHEN clients connect via IPv6 THEN the server SHALL accept and process requests correctly
3. WHEN the server runs in dual-stack mode THEN it SHALL handle both IPv4 and IPv6 connections simultaneously
4. WHEN network configuration is IPv6-only THEN the server SHALL still function properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a remote client, I want to connect to the MCP server within a private network, so that I can use Gmail functionality from authorized clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is deployed remotely THEN it SHALL accept connections from clients within the private network
2. WHEN clients connect remotely THEN the server SHALL handle requests with appropriate CORS configuration
3. WHEN multiple clients connect simultaneously THEN the server SHALL handle concurrent requests properly
4. WHEN unauthorized origins attempt to connect THEN the server SHALL reject requests based on CORS policy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the Railway deployment to be properly configured, so that the application runs reliably in the cloud environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Railway builds the Docker image THEN it SHALL use an optimized multi-stage build process
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from environment variables
3. WHEN Railway deploys the service THEN it SHALL automatically restart on failures
4. WHEN the deployment configuration changes THEN Railway SHALL redeploy automatically
5. WHEN the server runs in production THEN it SHALL have appropriate health checks and monitoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the remote MCP server to have proper CORS configuration, so that only authorized clients within the private network can access the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL configure CORS headers for allowed origins within the private network
2. WHEN clients from allowed origins make requests THEN the server SHALL process them normally
3. WHEN clients from unauthorized origins attempt access THEN the server SHALL reject requests with appropriate CORS errors
4. WHEN preflight requests are made THEN the server SHALL respond with correct CORS headers
