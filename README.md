## Advanced Search Syntax

The `search_emails` tool supports Gmail's powerful search operators:

| Operator | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `from:` | `from:john@example.com` | Emails from a specific sender |
| `to:` | `to:mary@example.com` | Emails sent to a specific recipient |
| `subject:` | `subject:"meeting notes"` | Emails with specific text in the subject |
| `has:attachment` | `has:attachment` | Emails with attachments |
| `after:` | `after:2024/01/01` | Emails received after a date |
| `before:` | `before:2024/02/01` | Emails received before a date |
| `is:` | `is:unread` | Emails with a specific state |
| `label:` | `label:work` | Emails with a specific label |

You can combine multiple operators: `from:john@example.com after:2024/01/01 has:attachment`

## Advanced Features

### **Email Attachment Support**

The server provides comprehensive attachment functionality:

- **Sending Attachments**: Include file paths in the `attachments` array when sending or drafting emails
- **Attachment Detection**: Automatically detects MIME types and file sizes
- **Download Capability**: Download any email attachment to your local filesystem
- **Enhanced Display**: View detailed attachment information including filenames, types, sizes, and download IDs
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for all common file types (documents, images, archives, etc.)
- **RFC822 Compliance**: Uses Nodemailer for proper MIME message formatting

**Supported File Types**: All standard file types including PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, images (PNG, JPG, GIF), archives (ZIP, RAR), and more.

### Email Content Extraction

The server intelligently extracts email content from complex MIME structures:

- Prioritizes plain text content when available
- Falls back to HTML content if plain text is not available
- Handles multi-part MIME messages with nested parts
- **Processes attachments information (filename, type, size, download ID)**
- Preserves original email headers (From, To, Subject, Date)

### International Character Support

The server fully supports non-ASCII characters in email subjects and content, including:
- Turkish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other non-Latin alphabets
- Special characters and symbols
- Proper encoding ensures correct display in email clients

### Comprehensive Label Management

The server provides a complete set of tools for managing Gmail labels:

- **Create Labels**: Create new labels with customizable visibility settings
- **Update Labels**: Rename labels or change their visibility settings
- **Delete Labels**: Remove user-created labels (system labels are protected)
- **Find or Create**: Get a label by name or automatically create it if not found
- **List All Labels**: View all system and user labels with detailed information
- **Label Visibility Options**: Control how labels appear in message and label lists

Label visibility settings include:
- `messageListVisibility`: Controls whether the label appears in the message list (`show` or `hide`)
- `labelListVisibility`: Controls how the label appears in the label list (`labelShow`, `labelShowIfUnread`, or `labelHide`)

These label management features enable sophisticated organization of emails directly through Claude, without needing to switch to the Gmail interface.

### Batch Operations

The server includes efficient batch processing capabilities:

- Process up to 50 emails at once (configurable batch size)
- Automatic chunking of large email sets to avoid API limits
- Detailed success/failure reporting for each operation
- Graceful error handling with individual retries
- Perfect for bulk inbox management and organization tasks

## Security Notes

- OAuth credentials are stored securely in your local environment (`~/.gmail-mcp/`)
- The server uses offline access to maintain persistent authentication
- Never share or commit your credentials to version control
- Regularly review and revoke unused access in your Google Account settings
- Credentials are stored globally but are only accessible by the current user
- **Attachment files are processed locally and never stored permanently by the server**

## Troubleshooting

1. **OAuth Keys Not Found**
   - Make sure `gcp-oauth.keys.json` is in either your current directory or `~/.gmail-mcp/`
   - Check file permissions

2. **Invalid Credentials Format**
   - Ensure your OAuth keys file contains either `web` or `installed` credentials
   - For web applications, verify the redirect URI is correctly configured

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - If port 3000 is already in use, please free it up before running authentication
   - You can find and stop the process using that port

4. **Batch Operation Failures**
   - If batch operations fail, they automatically retry individual items
   - Check the detailed error messages for specific failures
   - Consider reducing the batch size if you encounter rate limiting

5. **Attachment Issues**
   - **File Not Found**: Ensure attachment file paths are correct and accessible
   - **Permission Errors**: Check that the server has read access to attachment files
   - **Size Limits**: Gmail has a 25MB attachment size limit per email
   - **Download Failures**: Verify you have write permissions to the download directory

## Running evals

The evals package loads an mcp client that then runs the index.ts file, so there is no need to rebuild between tests. You can load environment variables by prefixing the npx command. Full documentation can be found [here](https://www.mcpevals.io/docs).

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key  npx mcp-eval src/evals/evals.ts src/index.ts
```
